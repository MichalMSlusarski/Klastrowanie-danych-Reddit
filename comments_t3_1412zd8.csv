"People. People have different views about everything. If you truly wanted to have world peace, you would need a ruthless dictator that would just exterminate everyone who was against the regime. I'm not saying that's a good thing, but think about it, do we really agree with everything our neighbour thinks about? No we don't, but if there was a totalitarian superpower that made sure you stay in the line... you probably would stay in the line.  

Now the next question is obviously, do we want to live in a such world? I personally wouldn't want to. But I don't think we can fully eliminate conflict because that's so deeply human. We're flawed and that is one of the reason we are so successful and if there was an alien encounter, it's more likely that we would be the bad guys.  

So sadly, I don't think we can ever achieve world peace unless we unite against something else to fight.",15

To add  a beaufiful contrast on this topic. Where there's fear there's attachment. Attachment to wealth, status or money(greed), attachment to concepts (religions & beliefs), attachment to self(ego) and so on...

"essentially world peace is ""unattainable"" it is similar to eradicating poverty. 

Think about it - what does world peace mean?

No being at war : America and some smaller countries will collapse almost immediately.  (it's not been at war/conflict/confrontation with someone only for 15 years in its existence); which will cause anarchy in financial world leading to... you guessed it, WAR!

&#x200B;

Fair Resource Sharing: does it really exist? if i have excess of something , and its valuable, (let's say water), and you don't, i'd sell it to you, and charge you depending on how desperate you are.. so that i can make my life better. eventually, there will be someone with weapons, trying to get that thing for cheap/free... essentially trying to better their lives.. which results in.... Conflict.

&#x200B;

Money? (see resource)

&#x200B;

Unfortunately, conflict is nature and natural. in animal kingdom as well, you'll see most conflicts (both inter and intra species) are only for resources (land, food, water etc.)

&#x200B;

The key takeaway is, peace is impossible, but minimize war/conflict is possible, with extreme levels of commitments.",1

Many leaders of African countries are put into power by the wealthy of other nations to keep up the illusion of scarcity. We have had education for centuries, and yet somehow African countries have been neglected until recently.

Stalin tried to ban religion but it didn't seem to improve matters. I think the more accurate answer would be 'blind faith in an ideology' which covers both religion and extreme political ideologies.,120
Even if every human somehow became an atheist we would still find reasons to kill each other. Religion is not what causes violence; radicals and fanatics use it as an excuse or justification for their violence.,1
Any destructive element of religion can be derived from zealous beliefs and dogma. That dogma can be applied to any belief system or ideology and be equally as destructive.,21
"This is not the answer. Clearly not. Most wars are simply greed for money or ground, ie power. Other than that, wars can be caused by extreme ideologies, which include nazism, communism, and yeah also religious extremism. Most of it is socialist ideology, though, which often even bans religious practice because the regime wants to monopolize civilian participation. Not to mention the plathora of things developed by religion that facilitate peace (these are the waters we're swimming in, so it's difficult to notice, so we take it for granted).",3
"Religion is a symptom, not a cause.

On the bright side, we don't have a choice, so don't worry, there's nothing you can do about it.",2

Don't necessarily agree that's its just money. Greed for power is a massive cause.,2
"It isn't quite that simple. Billionaires today are so because they own stock. Stock, famously, goes up and down in value on its own. Eventually, someone can become a billionaire because their stock has gone up enough.

That doesn't mean they can just spend it all as they please. Selling that stock would crash its value completely. So they sell off small numbers, comparatively, to spend. They can also take loans with their stock as security.

However, it's all predicated on the company doing well economically. If it stops doing well, the party is, no joke, over in months. Every company is a few bad decisions away from ruin. So, they HAVE to seek more. Those are the rules, and we set them. The billionaires are just an expression of those rules. With rules that allowed for a more ethical approach, things would be different.",1

"I agree, but Stalin, Hitler, Mao didn't try and get rid of religion simply because they didn't like it, they did so because it was competition to their own extreme ideologies.",11
It didn’t work for Oliver Cromwell either,3
Stalin didn't ban the Church.  He replaced it with Communism.  He replaced all of the rituals with ones concerning the State.,4
"1. There were a lot of things different at the same time in communist Russia. Being areligious is hard to separate from all the other factors and say whether it helped or hurt.

2. Banning religion is different than making religion not a problem. Banning a religion doesn't get rid of the religious, it suppresses them and creates tension and resentment. If you could just press a button and everyone would think their religion is dumb and give it up, I think loads of things would improve greatly at the same time.

I think we'd also see a lot of things still be backwards for different reasons, though. Women's rights would probably still suck in a lot of Muslim majority countries, just with different justification",2
"I think the idea that faith is virtuous is the difference here. Sure, weak-minded people can adopt zealous beliefs, but it’s mainstream society promoting faith as being good that insulates and cultivates those zealots.

"Most religions see themselves and their god as the sole truth and have - historically speaking - enforced and spread their claim with bloodshed. Look at how eastern religious beliefs dictate the social status of women and minorities to this day. How many murders are commited because of religion.

"Elon Musk kind of gave an insight into this mentality when trying to justify why he shouldn't pay tax on his wealth.

He described it as managing and allocating resources; money no longer means luxury and comfort to spend on himself, it means the power to shape society. He's using his money to play Minecraft in real life. Other billionaires are trying to do this as well, funding their own space ventures or building new cities in the desert.

That's why they continue to horde money despite having more than they could ever spend: they've set new goals for themselves that go beyond their own lifestyle and those of their children and in their heads they NEED more money to realise those visions.

The reality of course is that most of them are idiots surrounded by yes men who squander vast sums of money on failed vanity projects, while completely missing the actual good they could do, because helping end homelessness isn't as sexy as building a moon base.",283
"Im definitely not advocating for people having more than they need, but I think the point of having that is power, control, and status.

"I think it comes down to security. Specifically, the feeling of security and not security itself. People are naturally scared and want to feel safe and secure, and will do and believe anything that makes that happen. For example, being told its ""us versus them"" and ""I will keep you safe"".

Another aspect, which has gotten lost, I agree, is that many religions had a theological/dogmatic aspect and a mystical/explorative aspect. This is a safeguard against seeing yourself as possessing the sole truth. The mystical is actually related to the feminine aspect, which yeah, has been demonized a lot.

I mostly agree with you, for sure. But to say religion itself is the prime roadblock in our way to achieve peace, is to forget about all the positives that religious metaphysics has brought us, and to forget about the greedy people that are hiding behind religion.

I mostly agree with your final point, as well. The way people are going about it, and the way religion is set up, really ends up being divisive. ""My denomination, my religion, my building"". They forget what it's all about. Something like, how to deal with the gods, ourselves, and the world.",3

I mean you can stretch it as far as saying that US is to blame for the Marshall reconstruction plan post WW2 in Western Europe. But just because the Ukranian people considered that aligning themselves with European values would improve their standard of living has nothing to do with the US. It was a choice made by Ukranian people not by Americans or even EU (although we did encourage them a bit to abandon Russia and come closer to us).,3
"It's just hard to believe none of these society shapers got together and was like ""I think people should have access to the Healthcare they need"" or ""the health insurance industry is explotative"".

So they can shape society however they want as long as they don't fundamentally change society. And that's why Capitalsim is self destructive",97
"I mean some of it has to do with the fact that they can’t end homelessness or hunger, right? Take Elon’s peak, 240 billion iirc. That’s just over 1 year of the US government’s budget for fighting hunger annually.

The US alone spends 184 billion per year on fighting hunger. The rest of the world all spend billions too. 240 billion, Elon’s entire peak net worth, couldn’t even make a dent. People either underestimate the size of these problems or overestimate the wealth of these people. 240 billion is way too much for one person, agreed. But compared to the UN or governments, it’s pennies.",31
"Being rich is a much more disturbing obsession. Holding the record in a game is fun and people definitely go a little crazy to reach achievements like that but the ultra-wealthy are playing a much more serious game.

If you could set the high score in a video game and at the same time create new rules in the game that increase the difficulty for new players while funneling more points into your score, that’d be more like the ultra-wealthy.",122

Great insight! It is an unpopular opinion but your anthro seminar in regards to human greed is truly in all of us. It is just expressed in many ways from money (the most obvious) to coveting possessions. The idea of having or taking more than you really needs crops up in all faucets of our life. It takes a lot of introspection and inner peace to be content with having the bare minimum to life well. Especially for those in developed areas of the globe.,13

"But what we don't realize is that the pursuit of this kind of security causes further conflict. Any attempt to seek security in any kind of group, tribe, family, organization, nation, religion, etc. will cause conflict, because they always stand in conflict with other groups, tribes, families, nations, etc.

I think we have to seriously ask ourselves why this feeling of fear arises at all, which is actually the root cause for the seemingly endless divisions in our society.",2

From an interview he did...

PBS Newshour host Judy Woodruff asked Gates what he knew about Epstein during their meetings, and what he did when he found out about the allegations against him. ""Is there a lesson, for you or anyone else looking at this?"" Woodruff asked. Gates responded: “Well he’s dead, so...”",1
"Right the ""humanitarian"" efforts are very impressive on paper, but did they change anything systemically? 

I think a lot of people don't know how to think about the systems we live in. They only see transactions without realizing where the transactions lead.

So yes gates gave a ton of money to charities which is great, and he's saved a lot of lives. But that only sets up dependency on his contributions to save lives. It doesn't change the system so that lives are saved by the nature of the system.

The thing about our system is that we are constantly printing money, which is essentially borrowing against the future. Jet fuel NO2 economy now, which we are indebted to pay off later. Most of the growth of our current system is dependent and the labor of the future. Sooner than we might think, we will be unable to continue borrowing against the future. There will come a time when we cannot meet the required exponential growth that capitalism requires.

At that point, can we say that lives will still be saved by billionaires? Their inflated investments will be decimated by a government default. Will they spend what they have on their for profit initiatives or their non-profit ones? Would their charity be better served in making systemic changes that provide resilience at the community level?

Charity only works as a bandaid. Fixing the system to end exploitation is the cure. Billionaires only deal in bandaids- Gates included.",1
"Didn’t he also help fund AI? 

I do think what he did for healthcare is amazing",1
"Cuban is a good man, but his isn't a systemic change. It's a decent measure to ensure some of the most vulnerable are not *entirely* shafted. The exploitation continues. Because when people are entirely shafted you get revolution, which is obviously against the interests of capital.


 I'm not saying capitalism isn't useful, it's just not able to address the problems we are facing today. It's fundementally incapable of addressing things like climate change. It simply doesn't have the internal schema for it. Capitalism says grow, but doesn't have a clause for ""unless detrimental to living conditions"". It just requires growth at all costs or it fails. It's pretty clear that it's not sustainable.

Can we keep pretending for a while? Certainly. But the thing about the truth is that it doesn't need you to believe in it. Capitalism does need you to believe in it.

Reconsider your gods.",1
"There is enough food in the world to solve world hunger already. Capitalism is indifferent in allocating those resources to people who would need it, because they cant pay.

Indifferent, inefficient, or incapable of doing so. Whatever word you choose. The US throws away tons of edible food to artificially inflate prices. Farmers have destroyed crops to keep prices from falling. Lowering prices isnt a solution because the markets wouldnt allow it to happen.",20
"I think it's unfair to handwave it to ""just use the money better"" without qualifying what means. It's just demanding results and expecting someone else to do the work and failing to get the result must be a deficit on the person spending the money and not any real constraints one has to face in achieving that result.",1
I don't think that I am hand waving the issue aside. I am basically saying that ANY honest use of the money to improve hunger would be leaps and bounds better than the corrupt farce that the us government is doing.,1
