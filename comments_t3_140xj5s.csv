My lunchbag is in there, as is the whistle I use for gym classes. But I also have screwdrivers for quick repairs should I need to do them, everything from eyeglasses to desk height adjustments.

"I was homeless for about 2 months after my parents kicked me out (no one would approve a lease for me because I was only 18 and didn’t have all of the required documents; my parents refused to give me them) 
  
Somehow just one backpack was enough for all of my possessions. I bought a gym membership totaling a dollar a day, just lingered around there after work and took a shower. When it closed, I took my blanket out of my bag and used it as a pillow, and slept in the pitch black area of the parking lot. 
  
So yeah, just a cozy blanket, toothbrush + paste, charger for my phone, and a water bottle.",5127

You can bring refreshments, chargers, wipes, wallet, snacks...and you don't have to have bulging pockets. 

The question should be 'Why doesn't everyone carry a backpack?'. This particularly applies to men, who typically do not carry a handbag around with them. Why do the bros want to leave the house with fuck all?",241

"I've carried around a messenger bag everywhere since high school. It helps with my anxiety and has come in handy quite a bit because over the years it has become a ""prepared for almost anything bag"" so there is so much in there that you wouldn't believe and would probably think I'm crazy for carrying around with me all the time.

[Here is picture of the bag and a quick look inside](https://imgur.com/a/ty2wVtq), but bear with me as I empty it out for a picture so you can see exactly everything inside.

Edit: Okay [here](https://imgur.com/a/ZJNI0c8) it all is and I will break it down a bit more.

[Main big pocket and outside](https://i.imgur.com/5fcqEdD.jpg)

>From top left:  *grocery bag, book I am reading, snacks, note pad, first aid kit, duct tape, plastic bag, larger note book, bandage, spare pair of glasses, survival kit (got it gifted to me for Reddit Secret Santa), umbrella, catalog I got recently, flashlight, spare charger, two magazines, portable sriracha, hand sanitizer, water.*

[Main little pocket and pen area](https://i.imgur.com/d9f0SH1.jpg)

>From top left: *spare mask and gloves, sunglasses case, pens and marker, portable power bank, small Swiss army knife, lighter, emergency glass breaker/whistle/pen/firestarter/compass, spork and knife, bottle opener with small multitool attached, foldable straw, thermal blanket, cheap earphones, energy drink powder, instant coffee, USB adapters, towel that expands with water, roll of measuring tape, eraser, headphone splitter, toothpicks, and some band aids*

[Secondary pocket](https://i.imgur.com/f102F0h.jpeg?1)

>From top left: *thicker plastic bag, sleeping mask, small towel, inflatable neck pillow, Yahtzee game, hair tie, Clorox wipes, chopsticks, another charger cable, spare grocery bag, toothbrush kit, pen and markers, hand sanitizer, emergency deodorant, ear plugs.*

[Side pockets and back pocket](https://i.imgur.com/ZylC9Tc.jpg)

>From top left: *My everyday face mask, keys with seatbelt cutter and window breaker, emergency cigarettes, emergency whiskey (I'm not an alcoholic I swear I've gotten stuck many times in stressful situations where I/the people I'm with could use a drink, so I carry this), good ear phones. spare backpack, tissues, gum, condom, toothpicks in box with mirror, knife, eyedrops, hand sanitizer, another spare mask.*

So yeah that's it and in case you were wondering, it does weigh quite a bit, but I've grown used to it.",220
"I carry everything I could possibly need to keep myself comfortable.  It's down to a system.  

Health related stuff like Tylenol, eye drops, cough drops, lotion, etc
Hand soap
A bit of duct tape wrapped around a pencil
Pens, pencil and paper
Scarf
Gloves
Hand warmers
Rain coat
First aid stuff
Batteries
Chargers, wires
A small headlamp and a small flashlight for backup
A way to make fire
Quality Multi-tool 
I try to keep a change of clothing if possible
Pepper spray
Knife
Sawyer water filter
At least 2 servings of freeze dried food
A bit of cash
A map if I am going somewhere I am not familiar with
A compass

Sounds like a lot but really it is not so much in my pack that I can't add more things comfortably.

I drive to remote areas a lot, and these items will keep me alive for as much as a few days so that I can get to help or vice versa.  I have never been in so much a life and death situation but I have been in situations where one or more of these items has proven invaluable.  I live in an urban/suburban area, and even in those areas I still find them absolutely essential.  I got into this habit because I was once in a situation where I was lost and my car wasn't functioning and I had nothing but a miserable time on my hands. Never again.

Also I'm pretty sure I have OCD so this stuff takes a ton of anxiety off my shoulders.",29

"Same thing happened to me last year, I had five minutes to pack everything me and my little brother needed into a bag. My sister who's always been more of a mother figure took me in with her great boyfriend.

After a few months I got myself a new, higher paying job at one of the best companies to work for in the UK.

After that I found my boyfriend, then I got my own place, he's just moved in after I got him a job and I couldn't be happier with life.

I lost so much last year, my home, loved ones, was in therapy, broke my arm, etc. I never gave up, won't again, always kept fighting.

"I was gifted a ""micro-backpack""/slingbag by my dad that was entirely too fucking expensive (less than a decade ago it would've covered about 90% of my rent plus utilities for the month) for how small it is. It's a fucking purse. I don't care, I'll wear my little purse with pride as a cishet dude. It's great for going to big ol' beer tastings because it's big enough for a fairly decent sized burrito, a bag of snacks, an extra phone battery, and a small vial of medication and an extra pair of socks. Or I can squeeze my Steam Deck into it. Would I ever have spent hundreds of dollars on this stupid little bag? Fuck no. Am I glad to have it? Yeah, because it's hilariously stupid.",77

"Loss of housing security does hellish things to your brain. It takes a long, long time and a lot of work to feel secure again, if ever.

We get better but I don't think we ever get back to where we were.

Funnily enough though I also got really into camping and long road trips living out of the car after a stint of this. Maybe we like proving to ourselves that we could handle it happening again? We like to demonstrate control over the experience maybe?

"You have to contact the government agencies associated with the documents that you need (ie. social security administration, and the county records office where you were born) 
  
You can very easily fill out a short form and request a new drivers license, but it takes 6 weeks, so until that elapsed I was at square one 
  
First called the social security office that was nearest to me and scheduled an appointment. Then I asked my friend to drive me to my old house where I could retrieve mail from the mailbox that had my name. Thankfully their was an envelope there from my school that was addressed to me. That was literally the only thing that could validate my identity. 
  
Then my friend took me to the social security office and after about a 4 hours of waiting and doing an extensive interview to verify my identity , they issued me a new card and I had it mailed to my friend.
  
From there I scanned the card and used it to apply for a new birth certificate. They sent it to my friends house after about a month and he handed it to me in a timely fashion.
  
That’s pretty much all I needed for a lease, job, college application, bank account, anything really. 
  
But as far as my relationship with my parents, I’m just not a very sociable or personable guy to put it bluntly. So I’m not good at maintaining relationships unless there’s a crucial imperative. But I don’t hold grudges either, so I guess it’s a stalemate.",479

The exact question I was about to ask,9
"Honestly, I started using a messenger bag in high school because everyone else was using regular backpacks and I wanted to be ""different"" and over the years I just got used to them.

So with the toothpicks, the ones in the black case get used and tossed regularly and I keep the altoids tin in case I forget to refill the black one, which has happened. 

The little Swiss army knife is more of a memento, I found it in the cafeteria in high school and it's been a part of all my messenger bags since then even though it's not that great and the other multitool is useful because it has pliers. The folding knife is more of a backup for the knife I carry in the little pocket of my jeans. Sometimes that falls out and I don't notice until I'm out and I like to be able to have a spare just in case. The two earphones are why I have the splitter too, in case I wanna watch something with someone and we each have separate sound instead of the one earbud per ear thing.

You're definitely right about the hand sanitizer though, I didn't even realize I had that many lol, same with masks. That's just kind of remnants from early in the pandemic when I was super careful.",19

"My car is a dumpster fire, a chaotic pyre,
A rusty chariot, an inferno of desire.
Its engine wheezes and sputters, a mournful cry,
As I navigate the roads beneath the ashen sky.

Inside its confines, cluttered with debris,
The remnants of a life in disarray, you see,
My backpack, a faithful companion on this ride,
Bursting with chaos, like a carnival gone awry.

With every turn, a cascade of papers takes flight,
Unwanted relics of days lost, slipping from sight.
Tangled headphones, forgotten snacks, and tangled cords,
An avalanche of chaos that the backpack hoards.

Yet amidst the mess, I find solace in its might,
For it mirrors the chaos within, both day and night.
The garbage can of my soul spills forth with grace,
And in its jumbled mess, I find a sacred space.

For in the chaos, there lies a curious allure,
A reminder that life's beauty is often obscure.
The cluttered car, the overflowing pack,
Reflect the trials and triumphs upon my track.

The dumpster fire blazes with flames of insight,
Burning away the remnants of my past plight.
The garbage can whispers tales of growth and strife,
As I sift through the remnants of my messy life.

So, I embrace the clutter, the disarray,
For within its depths, I find my own special way.
My car, a dumpster fire, my backpack, a garbage can,
Symbols of a journey that I truly understand.

And as I drive on, amidst chaos and decay,
I find beauty in the mess, along life's disarray.
For it is in the clutter, the fires that burn,
That I discover the lessons I'm meant to learn.",54
My stomach is a bin liner,8
"I love this and wish I had the motivation to do the same for my work van, but it's basically my rolling office. Maybe I'll throw a junk backpack in there to start a habit",91
"Not even that. I've always carried a backpack with my work laptop, etc and don't live anywhere with usable public transport. What am I supposed to do, just toss my laptop in my car all loose leaf? Way more comfortable than a briefcase style ""laptop bag"".",66
"In the US that’s pretty much only major cities. Smaller cities and towns typically don’t have the infrastructure for walking around to get places (the sidewalks just abruptly end alongside major roads and then you’d have to walk in the grass or the road) and the public transportation infrastructure is equally dismal, to the point where it’s only the poorest people who ride the bus or walk. Everyone who has means has a car.

I spent a week in Berkeley and San Francisco a few weeks ago and it was amazing how easy it was to get around without calling an Uber. Between the BART (subway), rail car routes throughout the city, and buses you could get anywhere in the city easily. 

It was a lot of fun and I did carry a backpack that week because it was very practical to have one.",124
"I really don't see how you would get by without it. Hell, all my recent employers have issued people with backpacks so you can carry your work stuff between the office and home.",19
"My dad was an accountant and used a briefcase throughout the 90s, but in the 00s swapped to one of those leather pouches you tuck under your arm for carrying documents

When the accountants moved on, you know briefcases were dead.",193

I still use mine on contract days!",12
Man yesterday was 22 years. Good memories,9
You mean like the TurTurkeykey?,30
I have an osprey stratos and my fat ass loves that thing,14
"I feel like these people must have only used them in school or are my age where backpacks were uncool. Probably the kids that only wore one strap while on school even though it was super inconvenient.

The Jump Street 21 movie had a funny scene about that.",26
"When I was interviewing for college faculty jobs, the ""What to wear for the interview"" advice included ""don't use a backpack because you look like a student."" So I dutifully bought some faux leather messenger bag. It was SO uncomfortable, especially at the airport or walking around on campus tours.

What do I carry every day as a college professor? A backpack. And so do 90% of my colleagues.",9
"Yes but, who's on first?",9
"After almost thirty circuits around the sun, I solemnly reassure you that one day the inevitable will occur (you trusting a fart).",8
"I always pack with “Saturday, Sunday, and one to grow on”. 

I think the phrase came from birthday spankings back in the day.",7

"Now, is that like “the worst serial killer” as in an inept serial killer? Or “the worst serial killer” as in terrifying, unstoppable, never before seen level of serial killer?",218
What about a serial killer preparing for the worst.,33
It just seemed the proper way.,52

You leave George Banks the fuck out of this,8
"And even if you did look like a student. So what? Embrace your youthful look.

I had a teacher in highschool who was cursed/blessed (depending on your point of view) to look maybe 20 at the oldest, even through his 30s and 40s. 

He had a shtick where at the beginning of the year he'd try his best to dess like a highschooler and sit in the back of the class. He'd loudly say things like, ""I heard Mr.X is really mean. Cant believe I got stuck in his class."" Kids who knew him would keep quiet, and kids who didn't would get freaked out when he got up and introduced himself after a few minutes because they though he was just an older looking student. Great fun.",6
You,9
Didn't use the hated letter once in the  whole reply. Kudos!,68

"That's what happened to me at 17!! It sucked. The dumpster gods and some good friends saved my ass from starvation and dying of exposure. Couch surfing is substantially less fun than it looks, but WAY better than sleeping rough.",6
"Good on you!
I'm a father, and I feel the same way. My kids will. *ALWAYS* have a place to stay as long as I live. It may not be the most comfortable situation, but it'll be a roof, food, and a shower.",27
"Air compressors, brass connectors, wrecking chisels, smoke detectors. Tire guages, hamster cages, thermostats and bug deflectors.",120

Mr. Bean always gets his kill.,136
yes,58
"And he shall read the instructions  manual instead of just saying ""I got this"" and complaining it doesn’t work right",6
Like he would sullie himself with a backpack.,86
"I really like your idea, but does ‘nothing in the car’ also include car-specific stuff like stick-on blinds for the back seats, road maps, kid-entertainment, etc? 

Otherwise my backpack really wouldn’t be able to cope, and I definitely won’t want to carry all that stuff everywhere.",7
tell me about your favorite pen.,7
Bless you.,22
What a weird coincidence.,60
"It was always burning, since the world's been turning...",64

"That would be a spectacular movie. Mr. Bean as a serial killer, but not on purpose. He just stumbles on people in awkward situations then they die by his hand but accidentally.  Like say he accidentally pushes some high profile person off a bridge with his but while he is trying to get the perfect photo. He doesn't even realize he has done it.  He accidentally drops some nuts in some politicians food who is highly allergic then he somehow accidentally prevents them from using an epi pen.",10
"Thats not a backpack, thats a piece of trash that keeps his back from freezing in winter and it coincidentally can carry stuff. But it doesnt bc why would he need any material shit.",66
"I should mention that I am child free, so some of the stuff you listed, I do not have in my vehicle. In my trunk, I have a small trunk storage with velcro on the bottom. I keep my emergency kit in there, jumper cables, a mini air compressor, a tub of wipes, a hand held multi screwdriver, some duct tape, cleaning products, and some random items for basic survival etc.  In the passenger area of the vehicle, under the seat, I keep a pack baby wipes (to wipe my hands or when nature calls randomly), and a pack of Kleenex. But they are both hidden and only get pulled out when needed.",8
Fucking weird,12
I always carry a fire starter in my bag if you guys need a fire. Also paracord and a tick key.,21
"Man literally threw away his one possession when he saw a kid slurping water from a dirty puddle on the ground.

He is the epitome of Want not, Waste not. or something like that.",10
