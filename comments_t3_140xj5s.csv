I drive to remote areas a lot, and these items will keep me alive for as much as a few days so that I can get to help or vice versa.  I have never been in so much a life and death situation but I have been in situations where one or more of these items has proven invaluable.  I live in an urban/suburban area, and even in those areas I still find them absolutely essential.  I got into this habit because I was once in a situation where I was lost and my car wasn't functioning and I had nothing but a miserable time on my hands. Never again.

driku12,"Apparently, shrimp.

I'm not joking. Bought a backpack over a year ago, used it a couple times and then hung it on the back of my door. A few weeks ago I got it down to use it again and inside of it, sealed in a plastic ziplock bag (thank God) was an absolutely ancient, blackened shriveled but somehow still goopy bag of previously frozen shrimp.

I distinctly remember when I wore the backpack before, I got it during a vacation with my fiance at the time. I swear to God I do not remember buying any shrimp and had no reason to just carry it around in my backpack.

But there it was.

So, shrimp. I guess.",25

You can very easily fill out a short form and request a new drivers license, but it takes 6 weeks, so until that elapsed I was at square one 
  
First called the social security office that was nearest to me and scheduled an appointment. Then I asked my friend to drive me to my old house where I could retrieve mail from the mailbox that had my name. Thankfully their was an envelope there from my school that was addressed to me. That was literally the only thing that could validate my identity. 
  
Then my friend took me to the social security office and after about a 4 hours of waiting and doing an extensive interview to verify my identity , they issued me a new card and I had it mailed to my friend.
  
From there I scanned the card and used it to apply for a new birth certificate. They sent it to my friends house after about a month and he handed it to me in a timely fashion.
  
That’s pretty much all I needed for a lease, job, college application, bank account, anything really.

-eDgAR-,"Honestly, I started using a messenger bag in high school because everyone else was using regular backpacks and I wanted to be ""different"" and over the years I just got used to them.

So with the toothpicks, the ones in the black case get used and tossed regularly and I keep the altoids tin in case I forget to refill the black one, which has happened. 

The little Swiss army knife is more of a memento, I found it in the cafeteria in high school and it's been a part of all my messenger bags since then even though it's not that great and the other multitool is useful because it has pliers. The folding knife is more of a backup for the knife I carry in the little pocket of my jeans. Sometimes that falls out and I don't notice until I'm out and I like to be able to have a spare just in case. The two earphones are why I have the splitter too, in case I wanna watch something with someone and we each have separate sound instead of the one earbud per ear thing.

Leather satchels with a shoulder strap started being more common when people started carrying laptops. These were acceptable for the functionality of protecting the laptop and the leather made them look professional. Backpacks did start to evolve but weren't quite there yet.

And i would frequently also be carrying either a razor scooter (on dry days) or rubber boots (on rainy days where i might have to walk through several inches of water to get to class).

elefanteguerrero,"My car is a dumpster fire, a chaotic pyre,
A rusty chariot, an inferno of desire.
Its engine wheezes and sputters, a mournful cry,
As I navigate the roads beneath the ashen sky.

Inside its confines, cluttered with debris,
The remnants of a life in disarray, you see,
My backpack, a faithful companion on this ride,
Bursting with chaos, like a carnival gone awry.

With every turn, a cascade of papers takes flight,
Unwanted relics of days lost, slipping from sight.
Tangled headphones, forgotten snacks, and tangled cords,
An avalanche of chaos that the backpack hoards.

Yet amidst the mess, I find solace in its might,
For it mirrors the chaos within, both day and night.
The garbage can of my soul spills forth with grace,
And in its jumbled mess, I find a sacred space.

For in the chaos, there lies a curious allure,
A reminder that life's beauty is often obscure.
The cluttered car, the overflowing pack,
Reflect the trials and triumphs upon my track.

The dumpster fire blazes with flames of insight,
Burning away the remnants of my past plight.
The garbage can whispers tales of growth and strife,
As I sift through the remnants of my messy life.

So, I embrace the clutter, the disarray,
For within its depths, I find my own special way.
My car, a dumpster fire, my backpack, a garbage can,
Symbols of a journey that I truly understand.

And as I drive on, amidst chaos and decay,
I find beauty in the mess, along life's disarray.
For it is in the clutter, the fires that burn,
That I discover the lessons I'm meant to learn.",67
