SickPuppy01,"You get to realise those mistakes were made in all good faith at the time. The information you had to act on back then, can be totally different to the information you have now. You can only act on what information is presented to you. Presented with the same information today, you would probably make the same decisions today.

gnique,"I started off not giving a fuck. My father beat the blood out of me with a leather belt. My mother was too much of a cut to stop him. So the deal was he could beat me as long as he left my two sisters alone. That seemed like a good idea at the time.  And from this remove I am inclined to believe that I'd take it again.  It did instill in me that being a hero is all I ever wanted to be. 1966. I was 18 and headed out on my quest. I never went back except for my mother's funeral to make an appearance and my father's just to make sure that the son of a bitch actually was dead.

I don't regret a goddam thing.  I spent 10 years in the US Army, got a degree in Civil Engineering, raised more than three kids, started an engineering company 25 years ago. I was a very bad picker of women and got thrown back twice. My biggest failing is discipline and self control.  I turned 75 this year and I have been contemplating my life quite a bit lately.  I have recently been troubling over memories of combat from 1970. All the memories of dead children bother me and memories of what used to be called ""sight pictures"" are still vivid. I am close enough to death to honestly give it consideration. It really shouldn't bother me much cause, after all, I was not alive for 13 billion years before 1948.

I will say one thing that I found out and that's very few people have enough intellect to be kind and love their neighbors and to be patient and generous. Most people are just too fucking stupid to be good people...... that's why there are so many fucking Christians and Republicans.",14

typesett,"Try a journal

write in the journal about the stuff and leave it in the journal 

when you feel bad again, go back the journal and write maintenance updates 

for me, as I got older I see a bit better how my childhood went with the adults. As I wrote, it helped because I can see it from both sides and rationally that it was a long time ago

for me, the moment I got it off my chest in rational writing… I stopped thinking about it. I revisit when bad feels comes back

for people who committed heinous crimes and etc, get professional help",11
Ratnix,"Do some daily meditation on your life and eventually come to accept the fact that you made those choices, and your life is exactly where you led it.  

Spending all of your energy on regretting your decisions isn't going to make your life any better.  You need to come to terms with your choices and put them in the past and move forward with your life.  You can't change your past decisions. You can only make better choices moving forward. 

 So you need to accept the fact that this is what your life is and the only way it's going to improve is by making better choices.",20
challam,"Geez, if I had that attitude I probably couldn’t “carry on.”

You can’t change the past. There’s nothing you can do to re-do anything that’s already happened. Time only flows one direction (until quantum physics proves differently). 

You can choose to look at circumstances, positive and/or negative, and learn the lessons they have to teach. 
You can attempt to repair relationships if they were harmed by past action or inaction, but don’t be surprised or dismayed if other parties have already moved on. 

Your character will never grow or advance if you use your past like a carousel. All humans make mistakes, but we are not doomed to repeat them or make ourselves miserable by reliving them.  Yes, reflect on troubling occurrences, but then move on with the knowledge and experience you’ve gained.  

Regret is useless unless you embrace the lessons it has for you. 

Move on.",21

Pagan429,"Fuck it dude, let's go bowling! 

Seriously though, life is a long and strange trip, we all make lots of mistakes but that's not what defines you. What defines you is your ability to get up, dust yourself off and to keep on trucking! Learn from them and just be grateful you are alive, because when you are alive everything is possible! Life is beautiful and devastating, ugly and thrilling! There will be good times, bad times, I know I've had my share! Spending time thinking about what you did wrong, instead of what can i do right now is wasted time! Why worry, there will be laughter after pain, there will be sunshine after rain, these things have always been the same! You only get to live once. The dude abides. 

You come into this world alone, and you die alone. Everything invetween is your choice, choose wisely! 

Good luck my friend!",10
pmaurant,"I was young and naive in 2005 when I contracted HIV from my first boyfriend.  My life would be very very different if that didn’t happen.  I had plans that I had been working on for years but I had to stop them because I needed a job with good insurance.

GloomyAudience280,"As a middle-aged man who binge-partied in his teens, I can state that this is a mixed bag. Yes, I enjoyed myself, but I also battled alcoholism for years and destroyed many friendships. I lost most of my pals when I stopped drinking and going out. At the age of 21, I also dropped out of college, lost a nice relationship, and had to start again.

I did stop drinking, finished my degree in school, and am now happily married. I can't say I regret my youth entirely because it helped shape who I am today. However, if I had made wiser decisions at that time, I may have spared myself a lot of suffering.

Learn from those mistakes and move on.

My main worry is for young people, my grandkids, and all the young ones I see.  Most Reddtors included. I'm 60 in a few months.  It is terribly depressing, the world we are leaving behind.

I have a soundtrack on loop in the back of my mind that sometimes, in a lull, I realize is a long litany of regrets, some of which were not my making, but the rest are. I was not diligently careful in some of my decisions. There was one time a voice literally told me I was going to regret a major decision, but I ignored it, and it will reverberate through the rest of my life.

lollypop254,"I'm in my mid 30s, I feel like I've made some mistakes in parenting. I have to forgive myself because a lot of it was out of my control, circumstances mainly about abuse and being made homeless by my mum as a teenager. I feel better about those mistakes now, because I have learnt from them and am now actively trying to be the best parent I can be. This is better than my own parents. I can honestly look at my kids and know I'm doing a heck of a lot better at parenting than both of them put together!

I'm a single parent. I've finished a degree with a 2:1. I'm in a full time, remote job that pays really well. I spend a lot of time with my girls, taking them out to places and doing activities with them. They're well behaved and very happy little souls, always singing and playing. So I can actually see how much better their childhood is compared to mine!

I'm trying to pass on little bits of advice, especially around dating (my eldest has started noticing boys, and has started to notice that boys like her in that way, but she still likes to play with her younger sister). And I have open communication about the development of their bodies. Again a thousand times better than my parents!",1

My Way

Sex Pistols

EXPLICIT

And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
You cunt, I'm not a queer
I'll state my case of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
And each and every highway
And that, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
I saw it through without exemption
I've planned each charted course
Each careful step along the highway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way

There were times
I'm sure you knew
When there was fuck, fuck
Fuck all else to do

But through it all
When there was doubt
I shook it up or kicked it out
I faced 'em all and the world
And did it my way

I've loved and been a snide
I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now the tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think, I killed a cat
And might I say not in the die way

Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way

For what is a brat
What has he got
When he wears hats and he cannot
Say the things he truly feels
But only the words
Of one who kneels
The record shows
I've stuffed a bloke
And did it my way

Musician-Round,"Simple. Life is about growing and learning from your mistakes. If you get stuck thinking about whatever you might have done, instead of realizing that you were young and learning through your mistakes then you're inevitably going to live in regret.

Granted, if you intentionally did bad things, then that's a burden that you rightfully bare, and a sign of remorse and possibly even repentance. 

Only you know what you've been through in this life, OP. Look back and ask yourself whether your choices were made because you thought you knew it all, or if you did it even though you knew better.

LeMeuf,"Regrets aren’t inherently bad, unless you avoid looking into them or you ruminate on them and beat yourself up for them.  
To me, a regret can easily turn into a good thing. Something that leads you in the direction you want to go.  
I think it helps to think of it like this. You regret something you’ve done because inherently, it doesn’t jive with who you *are* or who you’d like to *become*. That’s a great start! The first question to ask yourself, who are you or who do you want to become in relation to that event? You already know you don’t want to repeat that! Perfect. So you know you’d like to do it differently next time. Next step, *thank* yourself for reminding yourself *who you are or who you’d like to become.* Say thank you for reminding you what you don’t want to do. Thank yourself for choosing to try a different path next time- you know you don’t want to do it again and you know you can do it differently. The final step is a little tricky but extremely liberating, and it’s the key to it all. Love that part of you- the part you didn’t like/regret. It can also be forgiveness, the point is to cultivate self compassion.        
Let’s use a generic example. Let’s say I lost my temper and yelled at someone I care about. I could ruminate and beat myself up for doing that, or I could try to learn from that regret. Step one. I already know I don’t want to act like that, and it’s not who I see myself as- (who do i see myself as?) I see myself as someone who is loving and kind. That’s why I regret acting like that. Step two. Thank myself for reminding myself that I *want* to do better and I *can* do better. Thank you brain, for pointing out that I am capable of behaving differently, and thank you brain, for reminding me I want to do it differently next time. Thank you. Thank you for believing in me. Thank you, for noticing I can be better. Thank you, truly. Last step. Love that part of you and/or forgive it. Forgiveness would look like this: I know I regret yelling at my loved one, but I know I can do better and because I am growing and learning from my mistakes, I can forgive myself. I can forgive myself because I was doing the best I could in that moment. I know it’s not the best I can do in the future, which is why I regretted it. I forgive myself for making mistakes because they help me grow into who I want to be. Loving yourself might look like this: I know I was really upset in that moment and I acted in a way I didn’t like, but I love that version of myself, too. I love that person who felt small and scared and felt like they had to yell to be seen. I love that person who wants to be better. I love that person who *knows* they can be better. I love myself for recognizing I am capable of changing.   
And viola! Forgiveness through self-compassion.  
If you do want to change your behaviors in the future, now would be a good time to make a plan on what you’d like to do differently- but it will be 10x easier and more productive if you forgive yourself first. Otherwise you’ll just keep beating yourself up.  
Hope this helps someone, because it’s helped me! :)",1

Alongside that you also become more aware of what you actually want as opposed to seems interesting in the moment. You also can build your life out in such a way that you create a platform (think money, resources, network strength, etc.) that gives you lots of options and the ability to change your mind with limited impact. 

Finally, you also realise that things that you used to think of as being severe and scary weren't actually in any way. Often that perspective is driven more than anything but simply not having the larger context at hand to frame things appropriately.

If there is one thing I could regret, it would be trying too hard to follow various societal expectations, but I can't do anything about that. It's all in the past and I learned from it. I can't consider something regrettable or negative if it taught me a lesson that led me to something better for me. Those are course corrections, part of life. Some were significant, but I don't have negative feelings about any of them. 

Generally, I have realized that regret is unproductive. What can we do about that stuff? Nothing, so why let it weigh us down. I also find that the longer I live, the more I learn that people I know who seem to have it all together have also had winding roads to get to that point, just like I have. The fact that some things took me a few tries or weren't for me at all along the way just makes me feel normal at this point.",11

So whenever I'm feeling like I need to vent or walk myself through something, just whip out my phone and write in my diary. 

I tend to keep physical journals for practical matters, like checklists, to do lists, etc. The phone diary is for more emotional matters. 

Everyone does it a little differently though. Different people get different things out of journaling. I have alexithymia so a diary helps me sort out what I'm feeling. Seeing the words visually clarifies my own emotions for me.",2
Jiktten,"Yes, that is the point. You *strive* to do your best but accept that sometimes you will fail in that and make mistakes, just like we all do. Then, knowing that you tried to do your best even though you were not successful, you forgive yourself for failing.",1
DogShitBurger,I feel bad for that kid because I was him when I was that age.,3
BobBelcher2021,"Sadly that is a realistic outcome for some people. I couldn’t get a date at 19 and I’m still alone 20 years later, though there were 4 brief failed relationships in the middle.

Some of us are just terrible at dating.",1
Structureel,"How my parents raised me without tiktok or instagram influencers telling them how to, is beyond me.",17
typesett,the 'get off my lawn' attitude is a real thing i try to fight lol,2
Casual-Notice,Fair enough. Fixed.,7
typesett,"I use the Coda app

I am a excellent written communicator so when I write, I become very logical and rational which turns me into my own therapist lol",2
ladybrainhumanperson,"Thanks for explaining. I don’t think i can because since I didn’t do my best, how could I have tried my best?",1
SonofSniglet,We were all like him at that age. Youth is wasted on the young.,11
MotheroftheworldII,"My parents had a book by Dr. Spock on child rearing. And they had other books, family doctor, and a lot of friends who had raised children or were raising children at the time my parents were doing so.",19
DogShitBurger,I'm actually pretty thankful that my parents didn't have to deal with a million influencers and Tik Tok douchebags telling them how horrible they are because they weren't in on the new parenting trend.  Were my parents perfect? No but they did the best they could've of considering that they were raised by ppl who were traumatized by the depression and WW2,1
Vexonar,"Wait are you serious? You don't think communities of parents knew each other, discussed situations? You really think, what, parents lived in a vacuum?",1
virobacter,Same here! There will be a few paragraphs of me just losing my shit. And then the last several paragraphs is therapy. Almost always has me feeling more confident about what to do or just more at ease.,1
Jiktten,"Because you are flawed. If you struggle to accept that about yourself, look at your friends and family. They make mistakes too, right? Do you think they deserve to feel bad about them forever?",1
mightyjazzclub,Brilliant,2
gummibearA1,"Our young and our relationship with them is the source of most of the  progress we see in society. If youth were to be encouraged to do anything from a young age, that should be to strive to be free while you still are young. Don't ask the old how to do that, only ask them what they were able to call success and why they got there",2
dont_care-,Yeah I read that one. My main takeaway was that you should trust your instincts because they are pretty damn good at this,8
AlDente,My mum kept this book by her chair in the living room (I’m from the U.K.). Apparently a lot of it has since been debunked.,5
typesett,"I was thinking about doing a new series called Happiness instead of just bad stuff lol 

Thoughts?",1
ladybrainhumanperson,"Well, I think they might be better able to cope with things being impossible to “unhappen”. For me things pile up and I can’t process.",1
ladybrainhumanperson,I also think I just had way too much happen at once and now I am so exhausted everything feels like crap.,1
MotheroftheworldII,Exactly. And if you doubt yourself ask a Grandparent who raised great children.,4
DogShitBurger,"Yeah  i don't have kids but I have plenty of friends who have teen and adult children and the parents who trusted their instincts and made good common sense decisions did better than the parents who were always obsessing over experts, parenting styles and trends",1
fl7nner,"Besides, the dudes a Vulcan. You just can't trust them",10
MotheroftheworldII,True about all that has been debunked. It was the go to in the 1940's and 1950's. There really was not a lot of other options I guess.,3
virobacter,"I think that's a good idea. I've also done stuff like that, where I can just keep things positive. As long as you're still getting the bad stuff out so it doesn't fester, and processing or reframing it.",2
Jiktten,It's definitely hard when that happens! Are you able to do something nice for yourself? Even if it's just making a cup of tea?,1
kellzone,"""Spock, are you out of your Vulcan mind?""",3
Strofari,Rather a Vulcan than a cardassian.,3
DogShitBurger,That and society was just getting started with understanding psychology and child rearing so it's only natural that a lot of that stuff has bern debunked. We're still learning and some of the stuff that we're preaching as gospel now will be debunked at some point in the future,6
MotheroftheworldII,Fair point and true. Look at all the ideas that were put forth during the post WWII era and even prior that more recent generations have disproven. There is always more to learn.,1
