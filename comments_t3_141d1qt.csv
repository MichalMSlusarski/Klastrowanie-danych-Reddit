"Iron Man 2

Because of Tony realizing his dad loved him after all (and that he was his greatest gift) and also because I liked Ivan Vanko as a villain.",240
"I quite liked ‚ÄòThe League of Extraordinary Gentlemen‚Äô upon seeing it in the theater. 

I was genuinely shocked to see nearly every review (and Sean Connery‚Äôs career) disagree with me resoundingly.",375
Water world,256
Godzilla (1998),190
Super Mario 1992. It‚Äôs just a dark sci-fi movie with Mario references and I loved it as a kid,64
"Evolution. 

One of the funniest movies of my generation.",198
Howard The Duck,130
"David Lynch's 'Dune'.  


Perhaps its just nostalgia from watching it umpteen times as a kid but I absolutely adore the original Dune. Sure it has its flaws, but the atmosphere, sound, and general -weirdness- really brought to life Herbert's universe I think.",45
"Cry baby. Johnny starred in it to ""make fun of his fame"" and ended up more famous for it. He's cute af in it despite how cringey the movie is lol",38
"Pacific Rim. 
Giant robots fighting giant monsters! What's not to love? 

The sequel was shit though.",329
I really like the newer king Arthur..,75
"Kung Pow. 
My friends walked out of this one in the cinema while I was on the ground trying to not vomit from laughing so hard.",176
Surf Ninjas.,32
"Stop or my Mom Will Shoot.

Not even the star likes it.

I find it to be a light-hearted police comedy and it doesn't help that the titular Mom reminds me of my grandmother.",57
"*Cutthroat Island* \- More like, people have forgotten about it. This movie deserves a lot more than what it got, it's a good pirate flick!

*Batman & Robin*: it's a camp classic, and I will die on that hill.

*Die another day*: right, some special effects left to be desired and the second half went off the rails, plot-wise. Nevertheless, it's as enjoyable and as rewatchable as any Brosnan-Bond film.",26
Alien 3. Everything about it worked for me. Gonna go listen to the soundtrack now.,27

"Lucy

Everyone shits on this movie. And I agree the ""science"" is incredibly dumb. But that's not really the point. It's a fun and entertaining movie if you aren't expecting it to give you an accurate neuroscience lecture.",98
Attack of the killer tomatoes üçÖ,17
"""The Shadow"" with Alec Baldwin.  Terrible online ratings, but it still makes me laugh.",18
"Any of the Star Wars sequel trilogy. I saw them all opening day, I enjoyed the heck out of all of them. Just rewatched them recently and, with a few ""I wish they had done this part different"" moments, I still really enjoyed them.

Had someone tell me I wasn't a real Star Wars fan for liking them and Solo. Had to inform them how mistaken they were... Lol",1
"The Cable Guy. This film is a contradiction of sorts I think. On one hand it appears to be a comedy of some type. Theres parts that are totally hysterical!

But if you look a little deeper and read between the lines this film could be considered a horror film. Its downright scary with the stalker aspect and hinting at the possibility of violence and death.

Also scary because the character that Jim Carrey portrays is a perfect reflection of people I have met in real life who are the same exact type of crazy that Chip Douglas is/was.",33
Waterworld,44
Bubble Boy with Jake Gyllenhaal. It hilarious,27
"Multiverse of Madness‚Ä¶oh, I‚Äôm sorry, was the movie about a magician traveling through the multiverse directed by Sam Raimi not as tight of a narrative as you wanted? You go to the butcher looking for vegan options as well?",127
"Secret life of Walter Mitty 

Defined my life for me.",69
Jupiter Ascending,36

(Also even while it's not hated but I think guardians of the Galaxy 3 was the best one)",13

"The Master of Disguise

I loved it as a kid and didn't even know people hated it until I saw it on lists of the worst movies.",26
"The Amazing Spiderman 2

I genuinely found Andrew Garfield's portrayal of Spiderman pretty good

The storyline and production can get some work but for what its worth, garfield's spiderman was pretty genuine in it

The Harry Osborn actor was pretty damn good too, his ""crazy"" act when he went goblin was strong",11
"Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me

Everyone in my life hates it, but it‚Äôs clearly the best movie ever made.",30
[deleted],58
"Thor love and thunder. It's funny, I had fun, the kid had fun, it got Thor out of his funk. I think it sets the stage for him to come back in a less silly capacity so I appreciate the goofiness.",82
Freddy Got Fingered,37
"Dracula: Dead and Loving It. For some reason this one gets a ton of hate, but I think it's just as good (if not better) than RH: Men in Tights or other Mel Brooks movies of that period",9
"Little Nicky. I don't generally like Adam Sandler comedies, but that one is hilarious.",1
PIXELS,32
Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the crystal skull,15
"Gravity.  

I‚Äôll wait for the many haters of the film to respond.",22
"The Village. I thought the acting was good, and I liked the twist.",47
Terminator sequels after Judgment Day,6

Multiverse of madness,6

"The Village (2004), so much hate but I really liked it, and the soundtrack is just gorgeous!",6
"Across the Universe. People are pretty split, they either love it or really really hate it",6
Battleship is a banger.,16
"Chicken little, it's my childhood I could never hate it",18
"Extended editions of The Hobbit trilogy. Love the vibe of the first two. Honestly, I don't like most of the third.

Yes, they are obviously inferior to the LOTR movies... But there is so much right in them, too.",11
"Age of Ultron. 

Maybe it's bc I never read the comics and am also not super into the whole marvel universe (even at the start) but I liked that movie. I still like that movie. 

Only thing I disliked was the Nat/Banner love story. Thought that was dumb and forced and went no where...

But the story and characters made complete sense to me, and I though the humor was so well done.",25
"Shooter. Not a huge Wahlberg fan, but I thought Shooter was tight, suspenseful, and exactly what it set out to be‚Ä¶",6
Battleship I don't get the hate.,5
"John Carter

Not sure why it gets so much hate.  I enjoy it every time I watch it.  Is it brilliant?  No.  But a thoroughly enjoyable flick.",1
Con Air.,1
Twister,1
"Equilibrium. While the fight style is incredibly cheesy, I think it's a great movie that's similar to things like 1984 by George Orwell. Dystopian in a different way. The reviews are super bad, but I like it. Plus, Christian Bale is the main character.",1
Ghostbusters the female cast one.,42
Attack of the clones,9
Free Guy,35
"Grown Ups. I think it's a great family movie series, and it shows the importance of kids spending quality time with family and friends. Most people seem to hate Adam Sandler films, but I like them.",19
"Battleship, scientifically dumb as bag of hammers, but a lot of fun",4
Spawn 1997,4
Waterworld,4
Dracula Untold,4
Uglydolls,3
Den of Thieves. None of my friends seemed to like it but I really enjoyed it. The ratings were meh but I would give it like an 7.5/10. I really enjoyed it. And The Last Witchhunter was fun too but everybody I know actually hated it lol,3
The Lost World,3
"The karate kid 2010. Not as good as the original, but still entertaining",3
"Most recently it seems to be the ‚ÄúUncharted‚Äù movie‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm a huge fan of the games, and it would be hard (like with most video game adaptations) to make a great film out of it. But it was a fun little movie, I look at it like junk food, was it great and a historic piece of American cinema? No! But it didn‚Äôt have to be!",3
The Cat in the Hat movie. It‚Äôs ratings are so low on rotten tomatoes but it‚Äôs just a goofy little movie. I grew up watching it so it‚Äôll always have a special place in my heart lol. No need to be a cinematic masterpiece,3
I‚Äôve heard a lot of hate for con air and Nicolas cage in general. I love con air and I love me some Nicolas cage. I loved waterworld and jumper as well though jumper could have been a lot better I really liked the idea.,3
Punchdrunk.  I liked it.,3
Paul Blart Mall Cop,3
Fast & Furious tokyo drift,3
"Waterworld starring Kevin Costner.

It's literally a play on the ""what would happen if ALL the ice caps melted at once?"" question. I am unsure of how someone would be able to form gills if they were in the ocean for too long though.",3
"Across the Universe. People are pretty split, they either love it or really really hate it",3
"x men origins wolverine. Yeah it‚Äôs not comic accurate and has its dumb moments but it‚Äôs entertaining af, at least to me",3
‚ÄúKick Ass‚Äù,1
"Little Nicky

I know it's in vogue to shit on Adam Sandler films, and I find a lot of them hit and miss.

Perhaps it's because little nicky came out at the perfect time for me, that I found the particular blend of comedy to be perfect for my adolescent sense of humour. I still enjoy that film to this day, although I think it may be more for nostalgia sake",1
"Mars Attacks!
I think it's absolutely stupid. But it's so funny!",1

"Strangely, a lot of Best Picture winners that Reddit hates (The King‚Äôs Speech, Green Book, The Shape of Water, CODA).
 
Except Crash. Fuck that movie!",5
"It Follows. Yeah, the STD monster movie. I objectively know it sucks, but I find myself randomly coming up with survival tactics. And when I'm walking the halls of work alone and notice someone slowly walking behind me, it makes me wonder if it is following me.",8
"blair witch project.

I think it's a very clever movie. The way the tension rises and that you never see the baddies.",12
"After Earth. 
Watch that without thinking people won‚Äôt accept you.",5
Sausage party,5
A goofy movie I reckon,10
"Super Mario Brothers... The old one, not the new one.",4
"I'm was surprised to grow up and see the hate about Fight Club. 

 Yea, if you're not the target market, it's drawn out and pretentious.  But if one was the target market...well, I'm not supposed to talk about that.",8

Ordinary People,2
"Antz.

I prefer it to Bugs Life but appreciate that‚Äôs not the common view. Nonetheless I think Antz got screwed by being released so close to Bugs Life, inviting the comparison. Probably having Woody Allen as the star voice hasn‚Äôt aged that well either‚Ä¶",2
The Pagemaster,2
Any Star Wars movie,2
"Movie 43

Look, I know it's not groundbreaking cinema and often relies on low hanging fruit for laughs but it does have genuinely funny moments and the story behind how it was made is fascinating.",2

TRON legacy. It's my favorite movie. Jeff bridges is a god.,2
Godzilla 1998,2
Crystal Skull and Last Jedi,1
I thought Solo was pretty good,1
"Morbius. I can‚Äôt tell you how many people tell me to throw the movie away. I liked it, and it‚Äôs one of the few movies that I‚Äôve rewatched multiple times. 

Also a bunch of Asylum films are good but terrible at the same time. No matter what genre they are labeled, they‚Äôre all comedy because of how bad and low budget they are.",1
"The Og Transformers movies, grew up on em and love watching them.",1
Tusk,1
"Doom. The 2005 version with The Rock and Karl Urban.

It's fun! Yes, it's completely different to the games, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.",1
"Exodus: Gods and Kings.

I am a *firm* atheist and I thought it was going to be a terrible film but I ended up loving it! Watched it like 3 times now lol.

"Spider Man 3 (Tobey Maguire) and Catwoman. Yes, they may be goofy, but I still find them fun to watch.",3
Evolution.,3
"I'm not sure if EVERYONE hates it but it's controversial: The Whale. Personally I enjoyed it and thought the directing and the acting was incredible, certainly Brendan Fraser's performance is worthy of an award. The film gives you a lot to think about, and hits you in the feels.",3

Spiderman 3,2
Beethoven (the saint bernard doggi),2
"Most M. Night movies besides The Last Airbender. Not a single person could predict his twist endings, which is a sign of good writing. The cinematography of his movies have lots of symmetry and rule of thirds, which result in some beautifully shot scenes. His ideas are original which is something Hollywood is currently in desperate need of. I also really like that his movies aren‚Äôt full blown science fiction. It‚Äôs plausible that aliens could invade like Signs, it‚Äôs plausible that nature could kick on its self defense system and start killing humans, it‚Äôs plausible there‚Äôs a community of people cut off from the world and still think it‚Äôs the 1700s. I like his movies a lot and he was reason I became interested in film to begin with",2

"That's a good movie, weird, but good",1
I liked the suitcase suite lol,28
"I was going to say this.  Based on Reddit, you'd think this was a garbage movie.  To me it's about as good as the first Iron Man movie.  Venko and Hammer are fun villains, there's funny scenes (where the humor actually lands), there's great action, nice character development for Stark, nice intro for Black Widow. I don't know why it gets the hate it does.  I definitely put it above IM3.",1
It's my favorite Iron Man movie,24
I don't think it is the best Iron Man movie but it's definitely the most 'Tony Stark' movie,14
Bird,1
It has that awesome suitcase armor!,1
Plus Black Widow taking out a bunch of bad guys while Happy is trying to deal with one.,1
"I remember the dissent at the time was that it was less of an iron man sequel and more of an ad for future avengers projects

a lot of the negativity around it was from people used to comic book movies being isolated, self contained stories, and the interconnectivity we're used to now was brand new

I think a lot of the iron man 2 haters from its release would no longer have this problem with it",1
Oh. I didn‚Äôt realize it was widely hated. It‚Äôs a good movie. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,52
Upvoting because I truly hated this movie,46
Oooo - bold choice,12
"It was part of that wave of campy blockbusters eg The Mummy, Van Hellsing so i didn't mind it was fun",1
"I love that one, it's such a fun movie! I know it isn't as good as infinity war, endgame, or other various comic book movies, but I still have a good time when I watch it. And most importantly, it's never morbin time in the league",1
"I really enjoyed The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and found all the literary references amusing. Still don‚Äôt really understand why it‚Äôs panned. Though I never read the comics, so maybe in comparison it‚Äôs a letdown? 

Also, the first 2 acts of The Avengers (2012) is almost beat for beat the same.",1
"Good concept, mediocre execution. The frustrating part is that Connery turned down Gandalf because he didn‚Äôt get it. He turned down another later-iconic role because he didn‚Äôt get it (IDR which). He didn‚Äôt get LOEG so he went for it.",2
"I really loved it, I feel like they could‚Äôve done a lot more with it and that was very frustrating but it‚Äôs actually one of my feel good movies.",1
water world was good,57
Mad Max at Sea world,1
"You gotta watch the extended version, though. It adds a lot more to the story.",1
Came here for this.  I think most people panned it mostly due to its insanely high budget for the time.  Similar to John Carter.,1
People don't like it?,1
This was a great movie,1
Came here to say this,1
Oh my god I watched this for the Nth time a few months ago and it still slaps,1
This was going to be my answer too!  Waterworld was legit one of my favorite movies as a child.,1

For you,1
"I see your Water World and raise you the Postman, which I unironically love",1
"It's been ages since I've seen the whole movie, but for a while there it was basically on heavy rotation on cable, and if I was flipping and Waterworld was on, I would 100% watch the rest of it.",1
"I feel like a lot of people (not all) have an opinion of the movie based on reviews and the fact it lost so much money and was seen as a waste, even though the reason production cost so much was that they had to rebuild an entire set after it was destroyed by a hurricane.",1
Is that the one where Godzilla lays eggs in MSG? That one was dope.,57
"i loved this movie! Not seen the later ones, but always loved the 1998 one.",14
Same,12
2nd best Mathew Broderick role behind Ferris Buehler's Day Off,1
bro that was a great movie how do people not like it,5
I‚Äôll admit it‚Äôs a good movie on its own. It‚Äôs just that Godzilla 98 is pretty different of being a actual Godzilla though. It‚Äôs a fun movie on its own but it is too different to be a actual Godzilla Film design-wise in my opinion. Still good film though to be honest..,1
"It‚Äôs Gojira, you moron! (It‚Äôs a quote don‚Äôt get mad)",1
"I rhought this was great. And on the VHS tape I recorded it on, I labeled the sticker as Super Mario Bros: A Very Cool Movie. And outlined it and drew Mario shit around it. I really liked that movie.",1

Haaaaarrryyy. His little jiggle dance,1
I didn't know people hated that movie,1
"I loved it when it came out, and I rewatched it a few years ago. It aged surprisingly well.",1

Love it!,1
"Man I love that movie, you just gotta see it as one of the good bad movies, like convoy",2
"Sting shouting ""I WILL KILL HIM"" = hilarious.",1
Dune is a guilty pleasure. Coworker of mine and I have been demanding a cameo by Sting in the new one because of it.,1
I loved it. I saw it as a David Lynch interpretation of the book,1
Really wish his Lynch's original cut of that movie was out there somewhere.,1
"It's probably because I'm from Baltimore, but I love all of John Waters' terrible movies

Serial Mom gets a lot of hate, but Kathleen Turner is so great in it",19
">despite how cringey the movie is

This is a John Waters movie, so the exaggerated campiness is definitely intentional.  If you like Cry Baby, try **Hairspray (1988)**, which is a masterpiece.",1
"I love the movie, but my daughter was just... *confused*.",3
"I loved that movie when I was a teenager in the 2000s. Then I rewatched a few clips of it recently, and it just didn't feel the same anymore.",1
I just rewatched it for the first time in decades a few weeks ago and learned that Willem Dafoe plays the prison guard ü§Ø,1

"Who doesn't like Pacific rim? I need names and addresses. This movie is awesome! Terrible film, great movie!",54
Did you watch the pacific rim the black? It's pretty nice.,5
I love pacific rim and the lore around it. I do not love Charlie Hunnam though. His speech and personality are very monotone. He was more robotic than the robots.,7
Everybody loved that film what?,3
"The Netflix anime was pretty good, if you can don't mind anime.",2
"When I made one of my first big boy purchases and got a legit Dolby Atmos surround sound set up and a big screen tv, that was the first movie I wanted to watch to test it out. Did not disappoint",1
Pacific Rim is a hugely popular film...,1
At first I was like wtf am I watching? Then I noticed it was a Guy Ritchie film and suddenly everything made sense. Jude Law also pretty much nails everything.,21
"The one where goes into the avatar state whenever he touches the sword? Yeah, guilty pleasure.",19
The scenes where he berserk mode with the sword is awesome!,7
"The one with Charlie Hunman is my favorite. Awesome story, visceral action, and not purely focused on magic.",3
I saw it without hearing anything about it and it was fucking great. Who doesn't like badass beat em up movies,1
"Guy Ritchie‚Äôs King Arthur?

I liked the first half but then the second half was a bit too paranormal/demon like for my taste and broke with reality a bit.

The soundtrack was absolutely bangin, I loved the training song montage where they include his heavy breathing as part of the beat in the song",1
People didn‚Äôt like this??,1

"I worked with the guy who animated the cow fight scene. He‚Äôs an older guy and it embarrassed him to no end that he had to make that. It was fun to bring up now and then. But also, he had such an impressive list of projects. He worked on the matrix and all the shriek movies as well as other dream work properties. So he had plenty to be proud of.",1

Then, I watched it in my late 20s and did not enjoy it. But now, whenever I see memes/references to it, I feel like ""hmm, maybe it is funny.""",12
One of the best comedies ever,1

">Cutthroat Island

> \- More like, people have forgotten about it. This movie deserves a lot more than what it got, it's a good pirate flick!

It came out when I was 8 and I absolutely loved it! Imagine my shock when I found out the rest of the world didn't. We didn't really understand how unpopular certain things were until the internet let us know.",7
We‚Äôll post a small monument on that hill for you üòÄ,5
"Yes! I loved Batman & Robin, not even ironicly. I enjoy the movie. I love Uma Therman. I thought the puns were fitting for the characters, and the art style of the film was unique. And I approve of the nipple suits, I mean, why not?",1
YES Cutthroat Island was one of my favorite movies when I was a kid! It definitely contributed to my lifelong love of Geena Davis.,1
"I like Batman and Robin too, but 90% of the reason I do is Uma Thurman",1
"*Alien¬≥* absolutely doesn't deserve the overwhelming hate it receives. Yeah, it had development issues and ended up messy at times, but somewhere between the theatrical release and the special edition that they cobbled together later lies a truly excellent movie.

""But... But... They killed off Hicks and Newt!""

And it was a bold choice that absolutely paid off. That immediately set the desolate tone for the entire movie and it worked.",1
"Honestly, I like all of the alien movies. Even the clone Ripley.",1
It was my favorite when I was a kid! Rewatched it a few months ago and I like it even more now that I realized that Tywin Lannister is in the movie,1
About time someone said The Postman.  I always liked the teenager who actually sets up a functioning post office and it works.,6
Eeekekekekekekekeek!,1
I disliked it as a kid but I love it now. I think it took life experience and wisdom to understand the symbolism and deep concepts it had to offer.,1
Loved it even bought the soundtrack. Looking at the trash/formulaic superhero movies out today it shines  brighter,1
"I agree, at least this one has an origin story.",1
We are in a very small club but we are members!,1
"OK, I will bite: What did you like about this movie?",1

"Ah, the non-Ed Norton 2000s Hulk.",1
I liked that. Perfectly good action flick with a great cast.,16
Wait. People didnt like that one?,12
I saw that movie so many times in the theater. I loved it.,9
"1000 times this. Everyone was on point in that movie. I have no clue how it wasn't a hit, everyone was coming off the biggest hits of their careers.",10
"Large swaths of that movie truly suck, but man do I love the scene where they ‚Äúpilot‚Äù the tank through the skies. I wish more of the movie was like that.",3
It‚Äôs a fun popcorn movie. A little implausible but entertaining,2
This movie just reminds me of the time in high school that my husband was talking to my sister and me about demons and we were asking him to stop because we were scared and he told us there was a demon in the Bible named Baracus,3
Every time Morgan Freeman opens his mouth it's some of the worst writing ever. But the movie is still awesome.,7
"Oh man, that's why I didn't like it? Where else am I going to get a neuroscience lecture?",1
Lucy was great! I watched it while analyzing data for my master thesis in neuroscience. Great way to spend an evening.,1
"I love this one too, when people bash the ""science"" in movies it makes no sense. Like ya, it's a movie, just pretend it can happen and roll with it. Limitless was the same idea",3
"Dude, I loved that movie back in the day!!",3
"Honestly The Shadow and The Phantom are both fun little time wasters, and you get Alec Baldwin and Billy Zane.",1
"Just chiming in to say I‚Äôm with you! I liked it, and the Matrix trilogy, and the second season of Altered Carbon, and the ending of Lost, and pretty much everything else the various fandoms rant about.",1
"This movie suffers from not being what people expected. The first time I watched it, it wasn't the wacky Jim Carrey movie I was looking for. Once those expectations were gone and I saw it again, I loved it. It's a really good, funny movie that gets better the more you watch it.",9
"Oh billy, it's been so long.... since I watched this movie.",1
"I think Waterworld had such massive hype, and people had such high expectations before it was released and people were really disappointed and thus exaggerated how bad it was. It was the most expensive film of all time when it was released.",10
"I loved it as a kid, but I gave it a rewatch as an adult and it's basically two women getting abused on a boat the movie.",5
"""Depends? On what?""   ""No, Depends, we're gonna need some. And about 500 dollars.""",1
"My issue with it was actually in the other direction, I felt it didn't go far enough. There wasn't enough multiverse OR madness by my reckoning. 

Probably my own fault, I went into thinking it would be more unhinged than would have been realistic.",43
"My problem with Multiverse of Madness is the movie title, I was really hoping that this would be *the* multiverse movie of the MCU. Instead we only got to see a few universes and variants. I would've loved to see another Iron Man, another Hulk, another Thor, etc. It's not the end of the Multiverse Saga so I still have some hope but the movie just did not meet my expectations. 

That being said, I still enjoyed the movie and it's among the better Phase 4 movies.",33
Visually one of the more interesting mcu movies for sure,4
"It was just kinda disappointing. It felt like there was no real progression of either the story or the characters. Most of the second act feels like it didn‚Äôt change a lot. 

Also it was advertised by YouTubers that it would be a darker, more horror like movie, but it really wasn‚Äôt, aside from one jumpscare",9
Not hated but underrated for sure.,19
I generally don't like Ben Stiller in most things and I love this movie,1
Same! I watch it when I need to get out of a slump.,1
Omg I love that movie; I think it got a lot of hate because of the Benjamin button scene but that quote from Sean Penn‚Äôs character about not taking the photo and just living in that moment is so insightful,1
I don‚Äôt think people hate this movie,1
"This was the first film I saw Eddie redmayne in, and why I can't take him seriously.",5
Hell yes. I wish they had made it a trilogy like they originally planned. It could have been so awesome if the studio had just kept their hands off it.,5
I loved this film!!!!,1
"Here‚Äôs my thing with this movie, it tried to do too much in one film. It either needed to be 2-3 movies or a miniseries. The core idea? Good. It‚Äôs no stranger than anything else we see in science fiction. Pick any one element a there‚Äôs another beloved sci-fi show, movie, or book that does it",1
The genetic-based physical refreshing tech they have in that movie continues to fascinate me. It seems somehow imminently plausible and juuuust out of reach.,1
"Haha, I was looking for this one! I love this movie. It‚Äôs so pretty to look at and fun to watch.",2
Jesus,22
"The rabbit hole of "" How did this movie get made""  is better than the movie",1
"I had such high hopes for this. 

I enjoyed films like Amazon Women on the Moon and The Kentucky Fried Movie.

The humor just didn't stick the landings at all in this.",2
"The Turtle Club scene was filmed on 9/11 and once you know that, it sits with you forever",1
"Turtle , turtle...",13
I see you‚Äôre AP vote and will raise you ‚ÄúThe Love Guru‚Äù! Gotta move M. Myers!,1
I thought everyone loved Bring It On?,43
"""*These* are Spirit Fingers!""

This used to air on USA all the damn time, and I'd always find myself watching it, regardless of when I changed the channel.",13
I downvoted you because everyone loves Bring It On. You didn‚Äôt answer OP‚Äôs question.,1
"In the same vane... Ant Man Quantumania

I feel like the movie gets hate just because hating on Marvel movies is cool now

The movie was entertaining, funny, and moved the cinematic universe forward

Was it perfect... Not by any means... But I still enjoyed it",26
"The reason I hate it, is because of a few reasons:

Thor feels like the most unlikely character to be so goofy. Sure, some people deal with depression through humor, but it didn‚Äôt come off that way to me at all

Gorr was completely wasted

The gods too, we‚Äôre completely wasted. I‚Äôm a massive mythology fan, and when I heard Zeus would be in it, I was HYPED. But they just made it a place to get a McGuffin. We only really met one god, and he was reduced from the most powerful Olympian, so terrifying that he terrified the whole coup staged against him(including Poseidon, Hera, Athena and Apollo), to a fat loser that was obsessed with his orgy

And lastly, the movie just felt inconsequential. It brought back Jane, just to kill her, no actual important characters died(Jane doesn‚Äôt count, because she hadn‚Äôt done anything since Thor 2) and aside from Thor gaining a daughter, there isn‚Äôt any important change from before and after the movie",5
I just wish they would have decided whether it was going to be goofy or serious.  The sort of in-between thing they did didn't really work.,7
"I thought it was ok, not the shit sandwich that everyone made it out to be. It got some laughs and I had fun. 

I do wonder if Taika Waititi JUST listened to appetite for destruction for the first time while making it though.",2
"I loved Thor Love and Thunder. I had fun and was laughing pretty much the whole time, can't ask for more out of a movie experience. I know people say it's too silly, but when you consider that the whole movie is Korg telling the story after it happened, it makes sense why it's not serious and I like it even more.",1
Daddy would you like some sausage?,27
THIS IS A FANCY RESTAURANT!,6
"My and my buddy loved that movie when I was a teen, probably saw it 5 times in theatres. 

*Years* later I was working at a pub. My manager had a guest stay after hours and they were ripping lines at the bar. I recognized this guy, but I figured he was just another bar manager or maybe local celeb, not all that uncommon of an occurrence and just gave em their space.

Anyway, a few days later it hit me. It was one of the stars of that movie. I messaged my buddy who I'd lost contact with over the years, told him what was I saw the other day, a great way to reconnect with an old friend lol",6
"Im the backwards man, the backwards man, I can walk backwards fast as you can, fast as you can, im the backwards man, the backwards man",6
"I saw that at the dollar theater when I was young, and I got ripped off. It‚Äôs not worth $1. I‚Äôd have to be paid to watch it again. I would‚Äôve walked out but I was dropped off at the theater and didn‚Äôt have a way home. 

But I still quote ‚Äúbackwards man‚Äù almost every time someone walks backwards, so it‚Äôs got that going for it I suppose.",2
"Whenever I hear the word ‚Äúhooves‚Äù in a conversation, I excitedly chime in with ‚Äúmy HOOOOOVES!!!‚Äù and nobody ever gets it",1
Where's your LeBaron Freddie?,1
"Yes!  
I watched it recently again after years and was surprised how much i enjoyed it.  
I remember the movie being hated quite a lot when it was released but it was a good movie.",13
"Agree. It took me a minute to settle into the 50's sci-fi B-Movie thing, but once I made the leap, I had a blast.

Is it as good as the other 3? No, but that's a pretty high bar.",1
"Yeah this is what I was going to write! I just found it a fun romp, I didn‚Äôt need to take it seriously or anything,  I just switched my brain off and enjoyed myself.",1
The science is pretty bonkers but it is well made and fun,4
"I  love Gravity, simple and straightforward movie, cant find reasons to hate it",2
I went in knowing the twist and all that and the scene where she's being followed in the woods still scared the shit out of me.,1
I liked it even though my roommate spoiled the twist for me.,2
Also liked Lady in the Water,1
"Parts of Spider-Man 2 were shot here in my hometown of Rochester, NY.  The downtown car chase scenes and other parts were shot in 10 days here.  Many of us went downtown and were random people on the street.  They put new signs on most of the buildings during post production.",3
That dubstep score. I enjoyed it a lot,2
"Also TASM 1. Tied with SM 2 for my second favorite SM movie. Great acting, great artstyle, great fights, great villain. And by FAR the best romance of the live action Spider Man movies",2
Battleship is my favorite dumb sci-fi movie.,7
"The scene where the veterans come marching onboard honestly chokes me up every time. My grandfather was a Navy man, and I can totally see him doing that.",1
"Yes, it is a fun movie with good action and actually sort of smart how they incorporated the game aspect into the movie. 

Also that scene with the veterans getting the ship ready always gets me pumped up and somehow a little emotional.",1
"Absolutely, those movies mean so much to me, and while I can understand people not enjoying them, they're very flawed, I really wish I knew more people who love them like I do",1
"I am right there with you, the first two man they were SOOOOO good !!!  
Ironically they didn't even mess up the stupid plots they added which weren't in the book, it's only that they were doomed to fail so the conclusions in the third really messed everything up cuz it was all total bs, but maaaaan they are GOLD, first 2  
altho I can't deny I love the first part of the 3rd movie, just cause it shows the consequences and finally we get to see inside erebor, but that's about it",1
"Ehhh, I'm not a LOTR fan so my opinion is completely unbiased. The hobbit trilogy just felt like there were absolutely no stakes in it. It got to the point where I started scrolling through my phone during fight scenes, that's how low stakes it was. 

As a kids movie, sure it's fine. I wouldn't be recommending it to my friends though.",1
"I agree. I know people were not fans of where Ultron went as a villain, but I loved his operatic, chaotic nature and many allusions to playing God. I felt that Ultron's unpredictability gave him more menace, moments like the one where he cuts Klaue's arm off in particular. And, it makes an excellent contrast with Vision's analytical compassion. The speech between the two of them at the end of the movie is one of my favorite scenes in the MCU",1
"This movie aged really well against the backdrop of Phase 3. I didn't particularly enjoy it at the time, but when I saw where the story ended up, I felt like it was a much better film...definitely much more important in the grand scheme of things.",1
I could listen to James spader talk all the damn day! Such a great villain voice!,1
"I gave it an honest chance, I like Melissa McCarthy and Kate McKinnon, but man it just wasn't funny.  A lot of wasted talent.",13
Same. I made my own screw-u necklace.,6
Edit out thr love story and it's a solid movie.,1
This has an 80/94% critic/audience score on RottenTomatoes and made over $300 million in theatres. That's about as close to a generally loved movie as you can get,37
People hate that movie?,20
It seems to be beloved everywhere except on r/moviescirclejerk.,6
I actually don‚Äôt know anyone who hates that movie‚Ä¶,14
"I fucking LOVE Grow Ups! It‚Äôs just these 5 dads having the time of their lives being with their families and finally reuniting after like 30 years, and just acting like they‚Äôre 17.",1
Banger,2
One of the best soundtracks ever made,1
"One of my all time favourites. It's got everything - romance, aliens, country music, donuts...what's not to like??",1
"The fuck you mean people hate that?

Tom Cruise had a huge ego and it's hard to watch him but that movie was üî•. Yet again, i'm a huge NASCAR fan so maybe i'm biased.",6
You have to have sex for it to follow you,10
It's one of the better well-received horror movies of the last decade though?,11
"Loved that movie, thought the ending was a bit shit though",2
Love this movie,1
Universally well liked.,1
I don‚Äôt think people hate this movie,9
"I really wanted to love this movie! 
When I watched the trailer, I was SO pumped for it. It looked like it was going to be amazing and it just fell so short for me. Shame! Glad you love it though.",2
"No one better hate this movie, it's a classic",33
"I haven't heard anyone speak ill of A Goofy Movie. Dafuq? If they do exist, I'd love to hear their reasoning.",9
That‚Äôs a banger movie!,7
No one dislikes that movie,5
My brother and I wore that VHS tape out.,1
Nice ending to your answer.,2
The first one was better,2
This was my preferred as well.,1
Thor was well received,7
"Isn't this like one of the highest rated movies ever? I forget, did it win an oscar?",5
The Hunt for Red October is overlooked?!? I always thought that movie was very well regarded right along with the Harrison Ford Jack Ryan films. The Affleck and Pine ones are the overlooked ones.,3
"Don't worry, you're not alone. I watch it every time it airs on TV.

Sean Connery as a Soviet captain, of Lithuanian descent and with a Scottish accent, is worth the watch alone. \^\^",2
Spider man 3 wasn't great but it was such a blast to watch,5
"I think we've established that ""ca-caw"" and ""tookie tookie"" don't work",2
there is no live action movie in Ba Sing Se,1
Terminator Salvation for me. I‚Äôd take more post-Judgement Day stories over new continuity like Dark Fate.,3
"I always wondered how the parents of the child who had Go To Hell Harry as an imaginary friend felt.  

Mom hears kid talking: ""Sweetie, who are you talking to?""

Kid: ""Go To Hell Harry!""",1
Every time I‚Äôve showed this movie to someone they hate it. I don‚Äôt understand why.,1
Mine too,7
Why? I‚Äôm genuinely curious. I remember watching it long ago but I‚Äôm ambivalent to it. I know it‚Äôs panned but I honestly am not sure why beyond it being different from the comic.,1
LoEG was terrible on so many levels. Connery just dialed it in. The effects were goofy. It was bad.,1
"*we meet, we distrust, we argue, we fight a little, shit goes down, gotta work together now* yeah, you right",1
"To be fair, I think he would have sucked in both those movies so he made the right move. He really isn‚Äôt a great actor, it finally caught up with him.",1
I agree,1
There's an extended version?,1
"Yeah, it's perceived as a 'flop' because there was no way it could earn back the money it cost to make. It wasn't that nobody liked it.",1
"I swear I became aware of it as a kid because it was in the guiness book of records for biggest flop or something like that haha.

Never watched it myself. I fekking loved Deep Blue Sea, Mad Max and sorta dig The Postman so apparently I should be cool with it?",1
"I can hear that rocking intro theme now...

Dude, does anyone remember the fucking awesome cartoon show that followed up after? Well I'll be damned.. I know what I'm rewatching while recovering from surgery today.",1
A bit of extra umami to your eggs,1
Can I have some ice cream?,1
Put some funk in it,1
"Once you go duck, you don‚Äôt go back! Loooool",3
"Those duck tits looked fake as fuck, rubber duckies at best. That plastic surgeon must be a quack, I sure hope it didn't go on her bill",1
Serial Mom is fucking fantastic. My dad actually knew the guy who got (if I recall correctly) an AC unit dropped on his head (my dad worked in DC area advertising and a lot of local voiceover talent and recording techs show up in John Waters movies),1
Long live Serial Mom. Kathleen Turner is a legend.,1
"Serial Mom is amazing! Cry Baby is fun, and worth watching if only to see Iggy Pop bathing in a bucket.",1
"Serial Mom is fucking fantastic.

I grew up watching Hairspray, which I quite enjoyed. When I was older I watched some of his earlier stuff. You can see who he is as a filmmaker, but there‚Äôs of course a roughness around the edges. I liked them, but they‚Äôre also *definitely* an acquired taste.

I felt like Serial Mom hit a great balance of polished, funny, and insane. It‚Äôs probably my favorite movie of his.",1
I‚Äôm pretty sure that movie was just Guillermo del Toro‚Äôs adaptation of some kids playing with toy robots and dinosaurs.,1
"I love it too, but what is the difference between a film and a movie? I thought they were interchangeable words‚Ä¶",1
Sadly a big portion of the human race doesn't like Pacific Rim. They're wrong!,1
ENOUGH!,12
Enough!,7
"That'll be 4 bucks baby, you want fries with that!?",1
My ass‚Ä¶,6
Yes! I watched it religiously as a kid and still love it!,3
"We're about the same age, then; maybe I'm older by a year, but that's it.

I also loved it and, likewise, it's only years later that I heard this movie was one of the biggest box-office bombs of all-time.

Before the internet, only specialists knew about such things.",2
Especially for Batman and Robin!!!,1
"Among the good points, the cast was friendly. Arnold, George Clooney, Uma Thurman, Alicia Silverstone... By all accounts, they enjoyed working together.",1
And the GENIUS warping of the 20th Century Fox fanfare helps set the tone even before that!,1
Even AvP? *I love it*,1
They are both the same Movie really just surf and turf,3
"I loved the unique origin story. I loved it being so emotional. I loved Nick Nolte. I loved the comic panels. *hangs head in shame* I loved the Hulk Dogs.

I know, I know‚Ä¶",1
That don't hurt hahaha,2
Did you see the sequel oh man,2
Did you ever see little shop of horrors. If not do. It cost 2000 dollars and was made in a week. The dentist chair scene was a mistake they didn't have time or money to redo so they just left it in,2
">This movie suffers from not being what people expected.

Exactly this. People expected and wanted Ace Ventura and that simply wasn't gonna happen.",1
"$500, yooouuuuu want, $500?!?!?!",1
"Yeah this was my general feeling too; I didn‚Äôt hate what was there but wished there was more. I feel like it‚Äôs hard for even good directors like Sam Raimi to do something really out there and interesting within the Marvel formula (the only guy who seems able to do it semi-consistently is James Gunn). I feel like the biggest problem is that it takes a lot of time to properly set up and explore a multiverse, because you need to either limit your characters and environments (as EEAAO did), make very creative and efficient use of exposition and visuals (as EEAAO and the Spider-Verse movies did), or take a lot of time to properly set up multiple worlds, characters, variants, etc, and Marvel has done a mediocre job at best so far.",1
Dr Strange and the 2 Universe Field Trip,22
"Scarlet Witch killing the Illuminati was pretty dark. And the movie ends with a zombie Strange wearing a cloak of demons. I don‚Äôt know how horror you excepted an MCU movie to get, but I think your expectations were a bit unrealistic. I‚Äôm already preparing myself for Blade being way less dark than it should be.",1
"Another one that stuck with me - ""To see the world, things dangerous to come to, to see behind walls, draw closer, to find each other and to feel. That is the purpose of life.""",1
Thanks for that.,1
Am I not turtlely enough for the turtle club?,12
"Yes, yes, and yes.",1
I‚Äôve never met anyone who doesn‚Äôt like Bring It On‚Ä¶,27
They do. This entire thread is karma farming. ‚ÄúI DONT CARE WHAT ANYONE SAYS! I LIKED LORD OF THE RINGS.‚Äù,10
I just said that in the same tone as the crazy choreography instructor who originally said it.,1
"So I like Quantumania as it‚Äôs own movie. As a stand-alone I think it is great. The reason I don‚Äôt like it (and the Loki series for that matter) is that it puts massive implications on all the movies that came before and seems like a dumb direction to take the MCU in. But JUST Quantumania? Yeah, it‚Äôs a good movie",6
I disagree. I've always delt with depression with humor. I don't understand why the folks say it needs to be one or the other.,9
"Good call. I forget exactly what my facebook post was after seeing Pixels but it was something like ""I should not have enjoyed this movie as much as I did.""",2
It‚Äôs the best - exactly as you say. Just relax and have a blast!,1
"It‚Äôs so cool, love that scene!",1
"Yeah, it just wasn't funny. My other problem with the movie was that no one could decide what they wanted it to be. At different points during its development/release, I saw it described as a reboot, a remake, a spiritual successor AND a new story that takes place in the same universe as the original movie. It was a mess.",8
"Check out r/moviescirclejerk. That movie combines so many of their least favorite things: Ryan Reynolds, Taika Waititi, pop-culture references, self-aware humor, sentimentality, and gaming culture.",2
Brutal,2
Correct and this can be said with at last half the movies listed lol,3
"I feel like this movie is VERY popular if you're a very specific age. Otherwise, you just haven't seen it.",15
lol right?! I love that scene where they are all at the psych office though that‚Äôs hilarious,1
I vaunt my burrd,7
"""Dialed it in"" doesn't mean what you think it does I think you mean ""phoned it in""",1
You two are adorable,1
"It's either called the extended cut or director's cut.

But yea, at the end, when the camera is zooming out on top of the mountain, it starts to zoom into a plaque in the ground that reads ""Mount Everest. Highest peak in the world""

So the Dry Land island is aftualy Everest.",1
"yes, and it's worth it",1
"For some reason, most people I've met that like The Postman also like Waterworld",1
"What flavour?


It doesn't matter. It's for my ass",1
And it was magnificent.,1
"They are

But when people are talking about artistry, it's often that they use the word ""film""

And when they're discussing stuff that's just fun, they use movie

Like pacific rim and Godzilla are movies, and I love them dearly

Across the Spider verse is film. Same medium, but when it's done so beautifully it feels weird to compare the two. One is meant to be artistic and thoughtful, one is meant to be fun. And both can and should exist together, and they really shouldn't compete",1
He just left! With nuts!,1
"Yeah, that was great. Definitely.",1
"Probably not, it‚Äôs been a looooooooong time since I‚Äôve seen the first one (back in the late 80‚Äôs/early 90‚Äôs). I‚Äôll have to find it.",2
"Thirding that this was the problem. The whole Medieval Times sequence is amazing, but even as a kid, Chip's behavior unnerved me and definitely registered as very wrong and not something to treat lightly.",1
You ever been BITCH SLAPPED by an EIGHT ARM GODDESS?!,1
AT my old school we never used to travel through dimensions.,1
I quote that line frequently.,6
Sure I can agree with that,1
"Using humor to cope with depression isn't what I'm talking about though.  

They made a movie about a guy killing gods out of revenge for his dead child, and a protagonist fighting in spite of a terminal disease, and decided to make it a comedy.

Those are pretty heavy subjects for a comedy, and I didn't feel like they pulled it off.",4
People hate Ryan Reynolds and Taika Waititi‚Ä¶.?,2
You're correct. I'm not sure why I said it that way.  Won't even edit.,1
Woo!,1
Awesome! Thanks for the info!,1
Exactly! I felt seven years old again after watching it!,1
You'll love it. It's worthy of the good weed that you hide when you're brother shows up,2
You three are great together,1
GDR!,1
